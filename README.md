ðŸ“± NeoBrowse is a prototype born from my earlier project social-media-WWW.
It represents a step toward blending visual storytelling, social interaction, and futuristic browsing in a single experience.

The app allows navigation through digital frames â€” currently using real screenshots from my own phone as the base. While not fully functional yet, it demonstrates the concept and flow of a new way to explore content, as if walking through a cyber-urban environment.

Built over years of iteration and creative exploration, NeoBrowse carries both technical experimentation and a personal legacy. It reflects my vision of systems that can grow beyond their creator and still deliver real-world impact.
